- Justin -- how do we find an immediate use case so we can see/use it? Not just a database table.

** [[id:D40AF73B-46F4-42EE-893C-B6B23B22CED0][Justin Klutka]] 1x1 Meeting

*** How to manage Ashley?
- Very direct, clear instruction

*** How do we tag everything for Heap?
**** [[id:878d1bcc-9cfe-4d42-b7c2-37ee29212747][Brian Troncone]] -- can we add IDs everywhere?

*** Content Creation and Consumption in fixed time period
Quarters -- high content consumption
We can effect that, by increasing features that explore our content
Or we release more content

More Tao and more Matt
Matt has specific revenue goals, walk us through the revenue goals
Translate that

How do we charge more and secure renewal?

More meetings with Matt to setup KPIs
Integrate the regular review of analytics into our product planning process

What features, software do we need to build to bring them to green?
Come up with a set of product focused revenue KPIs.
