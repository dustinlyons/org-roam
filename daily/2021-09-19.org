Research on [[id:00c29f40-e552-4b90-aa9d-ebc148a68208][Bitcoin Noobs]].

- Wirecutter is mobile friendly, and lends itself to long written form articles. I can easily make widgets/template "units" that are easy to add in and use. They can be:

  Headers, Text, Image, Review, Pros/Cons List, Horizontal Bar Graph

- ICO Drop. Research ICOs from this site to include on yours: https://icodrops.com/

- We want to build CryptoVantage, and translate it to other languages. And get hella links inbound to really good content. Keep updating it every month, adding new ICOs, and articles.

** Pages to keep
