Discovered a useful way to deal with large [[id:404986B5-3499-4173-8DD1-310E84513105][git]] repositories:

/"Up first: changing how Codespaces cloned github/github. Instead of performing a full clone when provisioned, Codespaces would now execute a shallow clone and then, after a codespace was created with the most recent commits, unshallow repository history in the background. Doing so reduced clone time from 20 minutes to 90 seconds."/

/"What if we could clone and bootstrap the repository ahead of time so that by the time an engineer asked for a codespace weâ€™d already done most of the work?"/

Note from me: they ended up pre-fetching. It's always pre-fetching for performance.

Found a very good resource on [[id:8508B49E-225B-428D-8C0D-1C2A0EF8A84E][Node.js]] security, should reference it if I decide to write some Node.js applications.

Taking notes during [[id:23E5974A-2B42-401E-A6D8-6C5BDD514D83][ScholarRx]] meeting for Planning and Grooming.

Feedback on [[id:B0547623-034B-4C5F-9386-831CE6FFDB65][Alex Hawker]] / Agile DevOps.

1. Don't be afraid to "control the room" and make it your meeting. If there is run on discussion, feel free to ask to take it offline for sake of time.

   "Quality of life mobile problem" -- you did this. Do more of it, no matter of personality.

2. Naming of stories. Not always clear. Have an opinion on the definition of a well named story.

Meeting with [[id:23E5974A-2B42-401E-A6D8-6C5BDD514D83][ScholarRx]] on Heap and NPS.

NPS in product will...

1. Remove selection bias from monthly polls
2. Much more data, and B2B as well
3. We can connect the qualatative with quantative to understand the weight behind the feedback

   2nd flash card
   Have they clicked at least two flash cards in the brick?

** Meeting with [[id:D878B71C-586A-432C-82D5-EE4FBD1456A6][Fraizer Stevenson]] on Bricks / Heap Analytics

- Serious user? We need those people.
- My job is designing, from start to finish, do they learn something?
- Depth of experience. Clicks make sense as something that a serious user would be doing.
- If a given cohort of students is taking longer on a brick, is it become it isn't clear or it's an amazing brick?
- Outlier bricks would be useful.
- We need to create a Segment of serious users
- If there are 7 quiz features, and they are only doing 2, do we need to update it?
- Look at value of bricks
    What bricks have the most views?
    What bricks have the most clicks?
- How do I judge the quality of the brick?
- Are the B2B clients being forced to do it? Let's only look at B2C.
