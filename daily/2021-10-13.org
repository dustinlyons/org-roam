Moving things around on my disk, settled on a /data directory so that my /home directory is something I can avoid. I"ll just create links there and use it as a central hub, but my real state lives in /data.

Getting my machine to MVP, which means package manifests and sym links in home directory. Then I think I'm good to move on to other projects.
