Headed over to Braeview soon to prepare for oven hood installation tomorrow. Looking at today, let's figure out the main tasks.

** DONE [#A] Write-up capstone project description for USF        :#Computer:

** Some thoughts on dates and Roam

- How do I get random stuff I haven't thought about, to "pop up" in Roam Emacs?
- How do I move windows about really easily? Open new buffers in new windows, close them, decide what window a link opens in, etc.
