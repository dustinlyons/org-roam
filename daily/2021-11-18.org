Well, I've been ignoring all my other responsibilities, but I've learned a ton about ZFS, Proxmox, and Nix-darwin. My 6 month procrastination (or longer...?) into building out the most amazing toolset to work on... haha. It's been fun. And I made a killing (minus Luna :( RIP) with crypto. So whatever.

MOving on.......
