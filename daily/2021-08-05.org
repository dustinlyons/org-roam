** Researching [[id:6ADF8FDF-7F29-4A17-9B30-C72E117C4BBD][Azure]] Git Hooks for [[id:F86C69F3-6DDE-4345-A206-F08F637FC313][Barry Rowe]].
  - Looks like "service hooks" exist that we can potentially use to run Jenkins or Azure ServiceBus if needed. That's pretty heavyweight though. [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/services/jenkins?view=azure-devops][Link]]
  - You can pick git events that will trigger the event
  - If it has to run on every PR, we could do something "dumb" that just checks if it's a hotfix and does nothing if it's not
