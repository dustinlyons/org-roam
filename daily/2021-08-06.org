[[id:69C564A2-3AB7-485A-B395-AC6E51F02972][Isaiah Lyons]] had his last music class this morning at the [[id:96DB66FF-57A5-42AC-86AE-5726F196510C][Louisville Academy of Music]]. I really enjoy spending that time with him and want to find additional classes and things for us to do.

Met with [[id:469720FA-E933-4D4F-BD12-75EAFD4F86E3][Dave Miller]] about a potential mortgage. He advised that I just get a W2 and a letter and move on with my life. So we will see how that goes with ScholarRx.

Asked [[id:D40AF73B-46F4-42EE-893C-B6B23B22CED0][Justin Klutka]] if I could move to part time, 20 hours a week, so that my mortgage would work out. We will see.
