I made very impressive progress on my guix system over the last several days. I'm pretty happy with it. Also, I guess I'm typing in [[id:06cac899-e253-4780-9ac7-63925973141f][Helvetica]] now and it looks pretty damn good. I may have to run with this on the website?

Thinking out loud. I should just start every daily note with an IFS journal/check-in, and a review of my linked references.
