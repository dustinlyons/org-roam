Another day, another dollar. It's Monday and I'm still feeling rather blah. Just pushing along on my projects, but defintiely feeling in the middle "lull"...

Amanda and I are fighting, I'm not talking to my family. I'm realizing many of my friends here in Louisville/Kentucky I no longer respect. Just having a hard time, lately.

On another note, I like my custom color scheme.
