Notes on [[id:8EA04865-94A8-480A-8719-417C67F4355C][Emacs]] window management.

| =delete-other-windows=                | ~C-x 1~      | Close all other windows                |
| =delete-window=                       | ~C-x 0~      | Close the current window               |
| =enlarge-window-horizontally=         | ~C-x }~      | Make the window bigger horizontally    |
| =shrink-window-horizontally=          | ~C-x {~      | Make the window smaller horizontally   |
| =shrink-window=                       | None!      | Shrink the window vertically           |
| =shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer= | ~C-x -~      | Shrink the window vertically to buffer |
| =split-window-below=                  | ~C-x 2~      | Split the current window horizonally   |
| =split-window-right=                  | ~C-x 3~      | Split the current window vertically    |
| scroll-other-window                 | M-pgup/pgn | Scrolls other window                   |

Things I typed and learned.

ctrl-x 4 f (file), d (dired), b (buffer)
ctrl-x - (shrink to content, like a shell)
ctrl-x 0 kills the window, ctrl-x 1 kills all the other windows
alt-0 jumps around

[[id:8EA04865-94A8-480A-8719-417C67F4355C][Emacs]] universal argument: use ctrl-u <argument> then the command, like ctrl-x [. to augment and pass a parameter into the thing.
