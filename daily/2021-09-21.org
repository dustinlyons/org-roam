Starting to be much deadlier in Emacs and I'm loving it. I can easily jump in and out of buffers, create and move about windows, jump into Roam mode and record, move, and otherwise manage my 2nd brain, etc. etc. I can only imagine when I start to do more and more (email, potentially Emacs window manager..?)

Been messing around this evening. What was my schedule again?

Not super productive so far today. I likely need to get back into the schedule. Or really, I just need a way to do a thing and then focus it. I like the pomodo timer idea. Let's look into that for Emacs, and continue down my org-agenda path...
