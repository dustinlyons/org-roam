So happy that Emacs is fixed. Had to bring over to my init.el but that's fine for now.

*** [[id:8EA04865-94A8-480A-8719-417C67F4355C][Emacs]] lisp development talk with [[id:2030ba5e-1fe2-40c1-b42c-64d3c92629d4][John Wiegley]]:

**** Key Bindings
***** Programming
- (bind-key "C-c e b" 'do-eval-buffer)
- (bind-key "C-c e b" 'toggle-debug-or)
- (bind-key "C-c e b" 'emacs-lisp-byte-compile...)
- (bind-key "C-c e b" 'eval-region)
- (bind-key "C-c e b" 'scratch)
***** Help
- (bind-key "C-h e e" 'view-echo-area-messages)
- (bind-key "C-h e f" 'find-function)
- (bind-key "C-h e k" 'find-function-on-key)
- (bind-key "C-h e l" 'find-library)
- (bind-key "C-h e v" 'find-variable)
- (bind-key "C-h e V" 'apropos-value)

**** Macrostep
***** If I get into macros heavily, this is used to jump around
**** eval-expr, M-C-X (evaluate region), C-x C-e (evaluate cursor)
**** paredit
***** check-parens for when paredit fails
**** elp for performance
***** (memory-use-counts) to see what is slow
**** Debugging (edebug)
***** find function using keybindings above, C-u C-M-x and then run your function.
***** Usually C-M-x runs the function. So to debug, it's just C-u when the function is at point.
***** D to get a backtrace
**** Workgroups -- alternative, coding, etc
***** Need this for org-roam/notebook vs coding
**** yasnippets
***** tab is going to insert points in his snippet, end up where ever $0 is.
**** backup-each-save
**** ediff, compare windows
