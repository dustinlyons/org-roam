Hit me that I'm feeling this way, sad, lonely... because I'm creating walls. I haven't ben affectionate with Amanda. I need to start hugging, holding, caring, listening, loving. Being back in love. I need to focus there.

Remember the Dario conversation? The person, the Senior Manager, super ambitious... blah blah blah... that person? He isn't emotional. Doesn't feel anything. Only wants success. He needs to go away for a while and we need the loving part to come online.

Can we talk to him?
