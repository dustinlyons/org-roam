#+title: Create an Emacs Workflow
#+filetags: Project Productivity

* Goals

Create a full fledged environment for writing and coding in Emacs. I need:

1. Environment similar to Roam with easy daily note links, 2nd window to have two pages open, backlinks, etc.
2. Vim splits, easy windows, jumping around
3. Amazing coding environment with syntax highlighting and so forth

* Tasks

** TODO Review emacs bookmarks and integrate into workflow  [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookMarks#h5o-2][Link]]  :#Computer:
** TODO Review org-agenda capture templates                      :#Computer:
** TODO Add [[https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion][org-transclusion]] mode and hotkeys to Emacs           :#Computer:
** TODO Study org-roam windows to make them work like Roam       :#Computer:
** TODO Be able to use date functions the same as Roam           :#Computer:
** TODO Create Roam "2nd window" and adding ref doc hotkeys easily :#Computer:
** TODO Create hotkey for Inbox tag and refile                    :#Computer:
** TODO Figure out Emacs windows and how to create Roam 2nd window experience :#Computer:
** TODO Create Project for dl-resource-importer                  :#Computer:
** TODO Setup free dropbox client + git cron job                 :#Computer:
** TODO use org-ql to create Project and Context views           :#Computer:
** TODO Review this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/445w6s/whats_some_small_thing_in_your_dotemacs_that_you/][thread]] and pull out some goodies              :#Computer:
** TODO Create easy popup for camera / photo on computer insert :#Computer:
** SOMEDAY Follow up on org-roam community to identify features you want
- When I insert a new node, I'd like to cursor to stop at the end of the input so I can keep typing.
- Or, I'd like to type [[New thing I want to create]] and then hit a key chord and it turns it into a Roam link.
- A much more, full featured buffer. Showing me all text. Currently, the workflow that enables an "empty" doc but a rich buffer isn't really possible.
- I'd love to visit links in the buffer easily. So I see the context and go there immediately (or open a window to see it, immediately).

** SOMEDAY Write a runbook to create and seed CRM file database
** TODO Sync Google Calendar and Outlook with org-agenda
https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-google-sync.html
** SOMEDAY Create a workflow for innovating new ideas (seedling, evergeen, etc.) :#Computer:

* NEXT [#A] Create agenda commands for the views you want, and change org-super-agenda to be simpler
- org-super-agenda priority: Priority, Inbox, Next Action, Waiting, Todo
- agenda commands: Inbox, Office (+ @Justin) Next, Office Backlog, Home (+ @Amanda) Next, Home Backlog, Errands Next, Errands Backlog, Waiting, Someday

* TODO Fix up spell checking in Emacs                             :#Computer:

I've hacked LSP-mode to give me Grammarly in org-mode. I need to figure out how to hit a key to auto fix / auto correct, as well as turn off company mode in this mode.

I've also hacked some things in the org-roam buffer in my Arch setup, to view more context and in a different order. Need to grab these as well.

Turn off a header in org-mode, no need to see file hierarchy.
