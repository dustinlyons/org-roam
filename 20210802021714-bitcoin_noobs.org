Title: Building a Cryptocurrency Data Feed on a Highly Performant Blogging Platform

This project will have two distinct phases, with different technologies and solutions for each. But first let me provide some context.

Recently, I purchased the website BitcoinNoobs.com with the intent to grow traffic and create a revenue stream from affiliate marketing. It currently runs on Wordpress, which I find to be a dated technology. Thus, instead of moving forward fixing it up, I've decided to start over. This should be exciting for students as we will start fresh, with the latest and greatest.

So this brings up to the project, which I define as the following:

1. Building a Blog Platform using Nuxt.js, Tailwind, and Netlify CMS

   We need to throw away Wordpress, and build something super fast and custom. I spent two years driving a company wide performance initative, across 10 engineering teams and over 100 individuals for Credit Karma. I have a lot of experience here and share that with the team.

   I'm looking to use Vue.js on top of Nuxt, Tailwind UI on top of Tailwind css, and host it on Netlify with git-backed documents versioned by Netlify CMS.

   I can help guide us through all of this: create a new Nuxt site, create or implement a "templating" feature with Tailwind UI, and then use those templates to port over articles from the Wordpress site. The goal here is to launch a simple blog on Nuxt.js (with the Content module), with some initial posts managed by Netlify CMS.

   I will work with us on this, so I don't expect students to do everything here.

   2. Live Cryptocurrency Price Feed

      Now that we have a flashy new Nuxt.js site, let's build price feeds for some of the major coins. I will have opinions on the design here (as I will manage it long term), but we will work together to craft a data pipeline to feed prices into our site. As it's all pre-rendered, there will be no live database, etc. We will just have to update it with some frequency.

      I'm very excited to work with a group of students on some cutting edge technology in a fun area (crypto). Join me!

** User Interface Design

Colors I like:
- #3c78f0 (Blue)
- #027f5e (Green)

** Ideas for [[id:ABB1E9A5-22E6-4D4B-8A5E-10269A51ED66][Amanda Lyons]]
- Translate the site into 10 languages, create and manage pipeline for translating new content
- Engage in Social Media, finding "noobs" and helping people learn how to buy and get into Bitcoin
- Reaching out to other places to offer to write or share content for them in exchange for linking back to our blog

** Ideas for Articles
...Buying an NFT requires a person to open an account on a cryptocurrency exchange, at least one crypto wallet, sending money to a crypto exchange wallet, connecting the wallet to the appropriate platform, and paying a gas fee.

* TODO Do a trial of GrowthBar to test SEO capabilities   :@Office:#Computer:
